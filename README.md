# SparqlExtension

This extension allows one to integrate Semantic MediaWiki with a SPARQL endpoint via a web-service. While this has been set up and tested to work with Joseki and Jena TDB, the configuration is generic enough to make it work with any other standard-compliant SPARQL endpoint. We are especially interested in hearing your experiences using the extension with other SPARQL endpoints.

See [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SparqlExtension) for more info.
